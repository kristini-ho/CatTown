This is more of a preference/generalization from various apps, but I noticed that some apps have a home screen that is kind of like a gate before entering the actual app. Or, certain games, like neko or other popular games have a cute loading screen. 

I also noticed that some apps’ starting screens have a faded background and some text overlaid on top. Combining these two ideas, my partner Alice and I decided to add a cute beginning screen that segues into the views controlled by the tab bar if the user taps on the screen to “enter the cat town.”

Then, the user is taken to the actual app features and can explore our various cat-themed tabs.

To answer the questions more directly,

1) The apps from which design inspiration was drawn include Neko (cute loading screen), certain photo/weather apps (with faded background), and game apps with a “tap to begin” button.

2) The design element mimic’d was the idea of a starting screen that doesn’t really do anything but acts as a pretty gate/door for the user to “open” to go inside the app.

3) I found it appealing because it kind of just adds an element of fun, a “time to begin using the app!!!” kind of feeling rather than the app contents being revealed right away.
